# ðŸ¤– AI-Powered Chatbot Project  

## **Overview**  
This project is an **interactive chatbot** built using **Python**, **TensorFlow**, and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. The chatbot leverages machine learning to classify user inputs and provide relevant responses based on predefined intents. It demonstrates how AI technologies can create meaningful and functional conversational agents.

## **Features**  
- **Custom Dataset**: Powered by an `intents.json` file containing tags, patterns, and responses for various conversational topics.  
- **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**: Preprocessing steps include:
  - **Tokenization**: Splitting sentences into words.
  - **Lemmatization**: Reducing words to their base forms.
  - **Bag-of-Words Model**: Representing text as numerical vectors for the model.  
- **Multi-Layer Neural Network**: A deep learning model built with TensorFlow/Keras to classify user inputs into appropriate categories.  
- **Dynamic Response Generation**: Based on the predicted intent, the chatbot selects a relevant response dynamically.  
- **Early Stopping**: Ensures efficient training by halting the process when the loss stabilizes to prevent overfitting.  
- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Users can chat with the bot and exit gracefully by typing "quit."

## **How It Works**  
1. The user sends a message to the chatbot.  
2. The chatbot processes the input:
   - **Tokenizes** the input into individual words.
   - **Lemmatizes** the words to their base form.  
3. The input is converted into a **bag-of-words vector**, representing the presence of words from the vocabulary.  
4. The neural network predicts the most likely **intent** based on the input.  
5. The bot responds using a predefined set of responses for the detected intent.

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries and Frameworks**:
  - **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training the neural network model.
  - **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**: For text preprocessing.
  - **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
  - **Pickle**: For saving and loading data like word lists and classes.
