 AI-Powered Chatbot

This is an interactive chatbot built from scratch using Python, TensorFlow, and Natural Language Processing (NLP)! This chatbot is designed to engage in meaningful conversations, providing responses based on a custom-trained model using an intent-based approach. üéØ

Project Overview:
This chatbot utilizes machine learning to classify user inputs and generate contextually relevant responses. It demonstrates the integration of essential AI technologies to create a functional and efficient conversational agent.

üîç Key Features:
1. Custom Dataset: The chatbot's responses are powered by an intents.json file containing pre-defined tags, patterns, and responses.
2. Natural Language Understanding (NLU): Preprocessing steps include tokenization, lemmatization, and the creation of a bag-of-words model for text representation.
3. Neural Network Model: A multi-layered neural network (built with TensorFlow/Keras) classifies user inputs into relevant categories.
4. Interactive Chat: The bot generates responses dynamically based on the user's message. Type "quit" to gracefully end the session.
5. Early Stopping: To ensure optimal training, early stopping prevents overfitting by monitoring loss during training.

How It Works:
Step 1: The user enters a message.
Step 2: The chatbot tokenizes and lemmatizes the input.
Step 3: The input is processed into a bag-of-words vector, which is fed into the trained model.
Step 4: The model predicts the most relevant intent, and the chatbot responds based on the predefined patterns and responses in the dataset.

Technologies Used:
Python
TensorFlow/Keras for building and training the model
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for text preprocessing
NumPy and Pickle for data handling

Applications:
This project highlights how machine learning and NLP can be leveraged to build real-world applications. Some potential use cases include:
Customer Support: Automating responses to common queries.
Virtual Assistants: Enhancing user engagement on websites or apps.
Learning Aid: Providing instant answers to specific topics.
